My name is Mark Roepke and I am a Senior Data Scientist at 84.51&deg;. I currently work in the Digital Personalization space and focus on the personalization of recipe-based services and the development of intelligent meal-planning services.

I am specifically interested in the area of data science education. I enjoy designing, developing, and delivering introductory R- and Python-based data science training workshops for those intersted in entering the field of data science. I am currently certified by RStudio to host Tidyverse training workshops and am resposible for R and Python training workshops at 84.51&deg;.

I graduated from Xavier University with a B.A. in Economics & Mathematics in 2016 and I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. Outside of data science, my interests interests tend to be fleeting. Over the last few years I've found myself interested in soccer, cooking, hiking, and running.
