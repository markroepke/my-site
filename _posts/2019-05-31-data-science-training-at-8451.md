I recently co-wrote an <a href="http://www.8451.com/sites/default/files/2019-05/Data%20Science%20Training%20at%2084.51%20-%20Brad%20Boehmke%20and%20Mark%20Roepke.pdf" target="_blank" class="class2">article</a> on data science training at <a href="http://www.8451.com/" target="_blank" class="class2">84.51°</a> with <a href="http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/" target="_blank" class="class2">Brad Boehmke</a>. Brad's role is specifically designed to focus on the areas of training and internal tool development, and a lot of my side-of-desk time goes toward designing, developing and delivering trainings within the data science function.

The article discusses our research-backed strategies on the development of data scientists through focused and objective-based trainings. We discuss how we organize our training workshops and the team delivering the workshops.

The article, along with other data science articles, is available to read on 84.51°'s <a href="http://www.8451.com/white-papers" target="_blank" class="class2">white paper site</a>.
