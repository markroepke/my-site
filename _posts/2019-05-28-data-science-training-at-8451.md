I recently co-wrote a white paper on data science training at <a href="http://www.8451.com/" target="_blank" class="class2">84.51°</a> with <a href="http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/" target="_blank" class="class2">Brad Boehmke</a>, Director of Data Science on the Specialized Functions team. Brad's role is specifically designed to focus on the areas of training and internal tool development, and a lot of my side-of-desk time goes toward designing, developing and delivering trainings within the data science function.

The white paper discusses our research-backed strategies on the development of data scientists through focused and objective-based trainings. We discuss how we organize our training workshops and the team delivering the workshops.

The full white paper will be available to read on 84.51°'s <a href="http://www.8451.com/white-papers" target="_blank" class="class2">white paper site</a> in a few days.
